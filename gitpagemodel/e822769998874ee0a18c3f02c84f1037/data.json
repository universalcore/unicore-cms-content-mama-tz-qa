But at the moment all I feel is worried. \r\n\r\nI worry about everything. What will the labour be like? Could I miscarry? Will something go wrong? What if my waters break in public? What if there is something wrong with my baby? I am also having nightmares when I sleep. \r\n\r\nWhen I wake up in the morning I don't have the energy to get out of bed. I can feel my baby moving around inside me but I'm filled with thoughts about what could go wrong. I love this baby with all my heart. My dream is that it will have a wonderful life. But the closer my due date comes, the more I worry about what will happen to me and my baby. Is this crazy?\r\n\r\nI wonder if it is normal to feel this way during pregnancy? In the beginning I was so happy and excited. Perhaps it is just that I am scared of labour, or scared of the reality of my situation. Either way, I love my baby and will do what is best.\r\n\r\n**MAMA HELP: Worry is one of the most common things mom report in pregnancy. It is more common than morning sickness and food cravings. You're not crazy. You're just pregnant!**\r\n\r\n",
