It is so clear in my mind: I want to care for this child and support it.\r\nI have never looked after anything before \u2013 not even my little cousins who were bullied in the schoolyard. I always wished I could help them back then. But now I know I really can help my own child. I feel like I\u2019m becoming a better man!\r\nBeing a father will be good for me. It\u2019s reminding me that I do have the power to protect others from danger. I am filled with such happiness when I think of myself as the father and the caregiver. \r\nI want to be faithful to my wife and to this child. I don\u2019t want to be a father who is only there for the big moments in a child\u2019s life. Or the man who stands up only to discipline the child when it misbehaves. \r\nI want to be there for every part of this kid\u2019s life. When I think about the job of a father, I cannot think of any other job that could be more important! \r\n\r\n**MAMA HELP: Being a father is a job for life. Even if you are no longer in a relationship with a child\u2019s mother, there are responsibilities. These are to your child. But being a father comes with all the rewards as well. You\u2019ll feel love and pride as your watch your healthy, happy child grow up.** \r\n\r\n",
