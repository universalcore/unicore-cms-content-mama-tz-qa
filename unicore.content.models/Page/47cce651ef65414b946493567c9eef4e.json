  "content": "Your baby is changing quickly. She can make basic sounds. She may even say something that sounds like \u2018Ma-ma\u2019 this month! \r\n\r\nDon't worry if she doesn't. All babies develop differently. \r\n\r\nSo far, she has needed your full-time attention.  Now she may be happy amusing herself sometimes. You may find her happily playing with her hands and feet! \r\n\r\nAt this age, it is good for your baby to be with loved ones or trusted friends. As she grows, your baby will need to learn social skills and how to interact with others. Your family will love having a cuddle! You can give her lots of cuddles when you get back.\t\r\n\r\nEven though crying is still your baby's best form of communication, she is also getting a sense of humour. Play peek-a-boo with her. See if she laughs when your face appears from under a blanket. \r\n\r\nYour baby will start to giggle and smile when you make funny faces and she will enjoy lots of silliness. She will also enjoy hearing lots of sounds. Click your tongue, whistle or make animal noises. She will love it.\r\n",
