  "content": "I had a long labour and a difficult delivery. I needed stitches for a tear. Once or twice I\u2019ve leaked a small amount of urine when I\u2019ve sneezed. The nurses told me to practice squeezing my muscles as if trying to stop the flow of urine. Now I practise doing this every time my baby feeds so that I don\u2019t forget. \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s been a few weeks now and I\u2019m starting to fit into some of my old clothes again. I have lost some of the pregnancy weight. But I still don\u2019t feel the way I did before. I look at myself in the mirror and see a dark line down my belly and stretch marks. The skin over my belly still feels loose and soft. My husband says I still look good, but I\u2019m not so sure. I feel older\u2026 and tired!\r\n\r\nI know my body is healing and recovering from the birth. I look at my beautiful child and I think it was all worth it to have him. But I didn\u2019t expect to feel so different! I suppose I AM different\u2026 I\u2019m a mother now. \r\n\r\n**MAMA HELP: The postpartum (after birth) period lasts from right after the delivery to 8 weeks after you\u2019ve given birth. Your body is healing from the pregnancy and birth. You will go back to the clinic for a check up after 6 to 8 weeks.** \r\n\r\n",
