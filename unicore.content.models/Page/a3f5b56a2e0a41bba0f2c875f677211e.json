  "content": "Before my baby was born, the one thing I knew for sure was that I made babies cry. How many times had an aunt or cousin put their baby into my arms and the baby had cried? It was as if the baby knew I was not meant to be a father!\r\n\r\nSo just before mine came, I wondered: what if my baby does the same thing? \r\n\r\nI decided I never wanted this to happen. So I made a point of finding out exactly why babies cry. I asked all my expert aunts! This is what they say: there are four reasons for a crying baby. It\u2019s hungry, it\u2019s in pain, it\u2019s got a wet nappy, or it\u2019s tired.\r\n\r\nBut can\u2019t babies also just cry because they are sad? \r\n\r\nThey can definitely be happy for no reason. The moment my daughter gave me a real smile for the first time she was around 6 weeks old. It was my best moment! It was as if she had just become a real human being. Babies smile at their mothers and fathers and other people they recognise. Then they grin and chuckle, gurgle and giggle. \r\n\r\nNow I seem to spend a lot of time doing funny things just to make my girl laugh \u2013 I pull silly faces, make animal noises, jump around like a frog, pull her toes. \r\n\r\nWhen she cries I do the 4-point check. I first make sure she\u2019s well fed, has a dry nappy, had a good night\u2019s sleep and doesn\u2019t have a thorn down her pants. \r\n\r\nWhen I\u2019m sure she\u2019s okay, then I work on cheering her up for real. I know some great songs. I can dance for her, read a story, tickle her feet\u2026\r\n\r\n**MAMA HELP:  A crying baby can cause a parent a lot of stress. First run through newDAD\u2019s 4-point checklist to make sure your baby\u2019s comfortable. Once you\u2019re sure she is, it may be time to bring out the singing and the dancing!**\r\n",
